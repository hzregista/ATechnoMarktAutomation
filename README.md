This system stores the records of a technology market. These are information about staff, customers, products, sales, stock, banks, contact, income and expense account.
The user can update, delete any record kept or enter a new record. The user can also create sales record, issue invoices, track stocks, and track profit-loss status.
The user can send e-mails to the registered e-mail addresses through the system. The user can also create notes for other users to see. 

On the sql side, I used a total of 12 tables, most of them interrelated. I shared the database as script file.

In the form, I used a chart to make the expense and inventory record more clear.
I used the webbrowser class to display the exchange rate information.
